## Bioinformatics pipeline to analyze Nano-C data

## About
Nano-C bioinformatics pipeline allows the user to analyze ONT Direct-RNA sequencing reads derived from Nano-C experiments. This pipeline employs a two-step mapping and filtering approach to accurately and reliably identify contacts within complex 3C reads. This pipeline comprises multiple scripts that all run automatically after the user provides information about the experimental setup and executes in  a single command. The overview of the pipeline is provided below.
